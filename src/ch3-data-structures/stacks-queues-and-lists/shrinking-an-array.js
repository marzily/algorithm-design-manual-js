/* Problem 3-3a, page 99
Consider an underflow strategy that cuts the array size in half whenever the
array falls below half full. Give an example sequence of insertions and
deletions where this strategy gives a bad amortized cost. */

/* Problem 3-3b, page 99
Then, give a better underflow strategy than that suggested above, one that
acheives constant amortized cost per deletion. */
